Graph Class
==
This class will create graph based on different datasets. 

Currently the code will take your data for every date, and turn it into a graph. You can do this multiple times 
for up to 4 datasets. 

Currently created makeshift project to test. Push the graph lib and class, and use the method in that master activity. 

IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE TO ADD  <activity
            android:name="org.achartengine.GraphicalActivity"
            android:theme="@android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen" />
To the manifest, so the intents can actually be created by the application.
